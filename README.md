## Description

This repository serves as a showcase of projects developed while learning C++. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to sharpen your C++ skills, you'll find a variety of projects here to explore and learn from.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **[NaturalSorting](NaturalSorting/)** - The Natural Sorting function provided here is a versatile utility for sorting strings in                                                                                        C++ based on natural ordering, particularly useful when dealing with filenames, version                                                                                         numbers, or any alphanumeric strings containing numeric parts.

2. **[CustomSort](CustomSort/)** - The sort lambda function provided here offers a custom sorting mechanism for two vectors of
                                    strings in C++. This function is designed to sort strings in a specific order based on certain                                                                                 criteria, offering flexibility and customization beyond standard sorting algorithms.

4. **[ReducingAdjacentWhitespaces](ReducingAdjacentWhitespaces/)** - This repository contains a simple C++ function named reduceAdjacentWhitespaces designed to remove adjacent                                                                      whitespace characters from a given string, reducing them to a single whitespace character. The function,                                                                        defined in main.cpp, takes a string as input and iterates through it character by character, identifying                                                                        consecutive whitespace characters and replacing them with a single whitespace. This ensures that the                                                                             output string remains well-formatted and readable, eliminating unnecessary whitespace.

5.4. **[RangeUtilities](RangeUtilities/)** - Range Utilities is a C++ library providing a collection of utility functions and algorithms for working with ranges. 
Partitioning: Partition a range into two sub-ranges based on a given predicate.
Dropping Elements: Remove a specified number of elements from the beginning or end of a range.
Flattening: Flatten a nested range into a single vector.

Features
